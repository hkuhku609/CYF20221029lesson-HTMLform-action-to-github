Exercise
Create a form that performs a search on GitHub. It should:

- Make a GET request to `https://github.com/search`
- Have a dropdown to select how the results should be sort by, with the `name` as `s` and possible values as `stars`, `forks` and `updated`.
- Have a set of radio options for the sort order, with `name` as `o` and possible values as `desc` and `asc`
- Have a search input field with `name` as q

If you want to open the search results in a new tab, you can add `target="\_blank` to the `form`.
